        <p>Spotlight Players is a 501 (c) 3 nonprofit, community theater company based in Canton. As you can imagine, it is increasingly difficult to support the cost of quality theater and day-to-day expenses on ticket sales alone. We depend on the
          generosity of individuals and sponsors to allow us to continue to perform in and for the community. Spotlight Players is eternally grateful to the companies in the community that generously offer fundraising opportunities to allow us to
          bond
          with one another and raise funds! We invite you to become participate in the many fundraising events we will be hosting this season! Visit our fundraiser page to learn more!</p>
